# 20 React: React Portfolio

## User Story

```md
For an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications.
This portfolio highlight 4 projects I have completed. It is a single page application with many tabs to highlight my skills in creating single-page application.
```




## Getting Started

You’ll use `create-react-app` to build your portfolio, which will include the following:

* A single `Header` component that appears on multiple pages

* A single `Navigation` component within the header that will be used to conditionally render the different sections of your portfolio

* A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section

* A single `Footer` component that appears on multiple pages

**Note:** Because this application doesn’t include a back end or connect to an API, the contact form doesn't need to save this information right now. You'll add back-end functionality in the next few weeks. In the meantime, consider including your email address and phone number on the Contact page.

### Projects

For each project that is featured in your portfolio, include the following:

* An image of the deployed application (either a short animated GIF or screenshot)

* The title of the project

* A link to the deployed application

* A link to the corresponding GitHub repository

### Design

As with the previous portfolio homework, remember that "good" design is subjective; however, your site should look polished. Here are a few guidelines on what that means:

* Use mobile-first design.

* Choose a color palette that distinguishes your site from the default Bootstrap theme and unstyled HTML sites. Refer to resources like [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) or another color scheme generator to help you create something that will stand out.

* Ensure that the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

* Consider using animations and React component libraries. Note that this will not affect your grade, but it might impact how potential employers gauge your knowledge.
